title: The Investing Hazards of Form 13F
---


There are a number of limitations to investing based solely on these charts. Always do your own due dilligence. 
<br>

1) On the day of release, a 13F can contain stock purchases and sales that were made OVER FOUR MONTHS before the filing. This is possible because Form 13F can filed up to 45 days after the end of the quarter. In fact, many funds submit their 13Fs as late as possible to maintain a competitive advantage over rivals. 
<br>
2) Although institutional investors must file form 13F by law, the SEC does not actually check filings for accuracy 
and completeness. Bernie Madoff falsified his 13F forms for years without the SEC noticing. 
<br>
3) Short positions are not disclosed in 13F filings. Funds can be long one week on a stock and short the next week. One extreme example in the healthcare space was SAC Capital's 
<a href="https://to.pbs.org/31Ve6HX">sudden choice to go short on Ã‰lan Corporation in 2008</a>, 
unbeknownst to retail investors. Additionally, some funds focus on short selling, with their long positions used as hedges. 
<br>
4) Stocks that are listed
on foreign exchanges and do not have American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are not included in 13F filings. As of 2019, 
there are over 150 biotechnology firms listed on European exchanges, many of which do not have ADRs. There is also a burgeoning biotech business taking shape in China.
<br>
5) These healthcare specialist funds tend to borrow ideas from another, leading to bandwagoning and overvalued stocks.
6) Canada, Japan, China, the EU/UK each do not have an equivalent for Form 13F. That means that these charts are missing many healthcare specialist funds.

<br>

Also remember that actual hedge fund performance numbers CANNOT be determined with public filings. One would need to obtain an annual letter to know that. 

<br>

Sometimes, a hedge fund's annual letter will be leaked, as was the case with <a href="https://twitter.com/biotechnova/status/1098718220947726338">RA Capital in 2018</a>. Other times, a fund's performance numbers will be reported to the media, as was the case with 
&nbsp;
<a href="https://bit.ly/2OieITR">Perceptive Advisors for 2014 through 2018</a>. Deerfield
Management also revealed its performance numbers in <a href="https://bit.ly/2EpeeWK">2019</a>, as
did Armistice Capital for <a href="https://bit.ly/356wjnC">2015 through 2017</a>.

This site benchmarks healthcare specialist fund performance with the WhaleWisdom.com <a href="https://bit.ly/2pxiyyh">"WhaleScore"</a>. However, all that the WhaleScore calculates is what an investor's performance would have been compared to the S&P 500 had he or she "cloned" the long positions of a particular fund every quarter when 13F filings were released. A fund's WhaleScore does not take into account hedging, short selling or private market/venture capital investing.
