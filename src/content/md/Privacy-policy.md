# Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. Varro will not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law and keep its systems secure. Varro only has your name and email address if you submitted an enquiry form, so there isn't much to share.

## Visitor Data Collection
Like most website operators, Varro collects non-personally-identifying information. This includes information such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Varroâ€™s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use the site. From time to time, Varro may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Varro also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that visit the site. However, Varro will not share IP addresses with anyone except to comply with the law.

## Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Varro uses cookies to identify and track visitors and their usage of the site. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Varro site, with the drawback that certain features of the site may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers
If Varro or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Varro goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Varro may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Ads
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Varro and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Varro may change its Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
