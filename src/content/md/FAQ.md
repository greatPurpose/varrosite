# Who are you?

See "About" Page


# Do you own stock in any of the companies analyzed on this site?

I may have long positions in these names, but no short positions. As mentioned in the Terms of Service page, opinions are strictly my own and not intended as investment advice. Always do your own due dilligence.


# Why share these intricate models online for free?

To collect my thoughts on digital paper and to generate discussion on BioTwitter, as many prominent users already do. 

I do not view sharing such information as a "zero sum game" that takes away my competitive advantage. The market is relatively inefficient and a fraction of institutional money managers read Twitter.  


# Why not post on the site with the initials "SA"?

There is far too high of a signal-to-noise ratio on that site in terms of quality of comments. With this site, I can embed curated Twitter threads directly on my reaction posts for news stories on each of the company pages.


# How can I download your Excel models?

Scroll down and click the download icon next to where all of the worksheets are displayed.


# Can you provide due dilligence services for my organization looking to invest in "X" company?

Yes, I can provide due dilligence services on names in this space. Contact to discuss.


# What other names are on your radar? Do you have any unpublished material/intermediate working products on other companies in the space?
