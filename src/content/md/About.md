# Showcasing the best research for the molecular diagnostics and genomic tools sectors

Thoughts on various molecular diagnostics and genomics tools companies with no particular goal, except to write things down on digital paper.

One of the biggest problems facing investors is the sheer quantity of research. That's where Varro comes in. It’s a service that finds great researchers, sifts through macro research from around the web and academic world, and showcases only the best content. It will provide a platform for top researchers to get their work better known.

While we will dabble in web scraping, we will rely heavily on the human touch. We'll use our decades of research experience and investor knowledge to bring the best market insights available. Nothing beats 100% organic, human intelligence.

We deliver our content through our website, newsletters, podcasts, and videos. It’s succinct, straight-to-point, and actionable. We're currently in the build-out phase, so all the content will be free. This will allow us to get your valuable feedback and build a better service. Eventually, we will move to a paid subscription model. We’ve haven’t decided on the cost yet, but we’ll try to make it as accessible to all as possible.

Hazards section notes at bottom
-Short positions are not disclosed in 13F's, which makes investing sole based on 13F's flawed
-Based on previous quarter---no guarantee of continuation of stock ownership or puts/calls. In fact, there have been publicized cases where funds go short on previous longs based on new information they acquire. Always do you own due dilligence and do not aimlessly follow.
